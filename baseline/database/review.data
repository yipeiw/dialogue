It's hard to bring bond into modern film without annoying loyal fans. Wasn't it the previous film that left out the 'bond, james bond' introduction and the theme song!
Fantastic scene! Really, beyond any expectations within the Bond movieworld, really unbelievable! What a music!
Judi Dench is the best actress.
It's the best Bond film ever. It has a proper story instead of being made up of gimmicks and setpieces as so many of the others have. 
It takes risks - inverting the traditional third act to put Bond on the defensive, creating a fabulously sympathetic monster in Silva and turning Bond into a believable character.
This was absolutley the WORST Bond movie i have ever seen.Overlong.Boring.A plot which makes no sense at all and a Bond who looks and acts like a low life scumbag.
Bond is like a fine wine. It gets better with age. My credentials; I own the full collection in Blu-ray. There are no bad Bond movies, only bad people.
In "Skyfall" Bond we find the most dark and dreary, the famous British spy becoming a serious character, tough and realistic.
The first 10 minutes or so were great, Bond's on a mission and there are some memorable scenes (digger coupling the trains), but there are major plot-holes. When Bond is fighting on top of the train for the hard- drive, Eve says that she has a shot.
